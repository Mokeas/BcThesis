# Natural Language Generation system writing football articles
_**Bachelor thesis at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Czech Republic, 2022**_

**Abstract of the thesis**: Journalism could become a tedious job as its main concern is to create as many articles as possible, usually prioritising quantity over quality. Some articles are quite routine and they need to exist just because most of the population is able to interpret data only in a very convenient text representation. The idea is to ease this job and generate articles, particularly about football in Czech language, automatically from non-linguistic data. 
This paper is concerned with analysing implementation of such a linguistic software and moreover offers a brief overview of a Natural Language Generation (NLG) process. The major focus of this overview is on benefits and drawbacks of different approaches to NLG as well as describing NLG tasks and its challenges you need to overcome in order to produce a similar human language (not only Czech) producing program. 

## Content of the project
In the project, there are two directories:

* **_BcText_**: the textual version of the thesis written in TeX </li>
* **_FootballArticlesGenerator_**: Python software that produces football articles</li>


## Text of the thesis

Text of the thesis describes the project _FootballArticlesGenerator_ in depth as well as the process of Natural Language Generation (NLG) in general. The target audience of the thesis are computer scientists, which are interested (but relatively new) in the field of computational linguistic. The aim of the text is to broaden reader's knowledge in the field of NLG as well as give an idea how to approach similar project. 

Note: University's bachelor thesis template (version 2020-04-17) was used when setting in TeX. 

## Football Articles Generator

Project is written purely in Python. Project contains separate modules, which are described briefly in the code as comments or in detail in the thesis. The project contains one example JSON file of input data: _example_match.json_.
