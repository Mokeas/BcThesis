In this thesis we described process of NLG system end-to-end with tasks that are needed to take into consideration in order to create fully functioning solution. We have covered the basics of NLG such as different approaches and their core benefits and drawbacks. Moreover, we have illustrated numerous problems that can arise during the development and that are required to be dealt with beforehand.
In the second section we present an implementation of such a text-generating system that uses slightly outdated (for reasons stated throughout the thesis multiple times) methods. Football articles generated by this software are readable, fluid and somewhat variable. Outputted text are with only a handful of mistakes (grammatical, not factual). 

Personally, I am happy with the result. The NLG system I have created is end-to-end and transforms raw data into a well-built text, which is non-trivial and variable to some extent. However, the core consequence I am glad for is the amount of knowledge I have gained in the field of NLG. I would hope, that somebody will use this text as a learning material when exploring the field of NLG and will find all the information useful.
