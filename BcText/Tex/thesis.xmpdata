\Title{Natural Language Generation system writing football articles}
\Keywords{linguistics\football\NLG\natural language generation\article}
\Subject{Journalism could become a tedious job as its main concern is to create as many articles as possible, usually prioritising quantity over quality. Some articles are quite routine and they need to exist just because most of the population is able to interpret data only in a very convenient text representation. The idea is to ease this job and generate articles, particularly about football in Czech language, automatically from non-linguistic data. This thesis is concerned with analysing implementation of such a linguistic software and moreover offers a brief overview of a Natural Language Generation (NLG) process. The major focus of this overview is on benefits and drawbacks of different approaches to NLG as well as describing NLG tasks and its challenges you need to overcome in order to produce a similar human language (not only Czech) producing program. }
